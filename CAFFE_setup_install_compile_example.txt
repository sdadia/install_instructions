Installation and Setup instruction for Caffe on Debian, and python 3

Alternatively, refer to this post
  http://codrspace.com/sdadia/install-caffe-with-python-3-opencv-3-support-Debian-Ubuntu/

Prerequisites 
  - Install OpenCV 3
  - Install Python 3
  

(1) Download caffe from github and extract it

(2) Install Dependencies
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
  sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
  sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev  protobuf-compiler
  sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev
  sudo apt-get install libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev  libhdf5-serial-dev
  sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev

  For DEBIAN:
    cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
    sudo ln -s libhdf5_serial.so.8.0.2 libhdf5.so
    sudo ln -s libhdf5_serial_hl.so.8.0.2 libhdf5_hl.so
  
  No such chagen for UBUNTU
  

(3) Edit Makefile 
  After you extracted caffe, go into the folder, and copy the Makefile.config.example
  cp Makefile.config.example  Makefile.config

(4) Change the following lines in the new Makefile.config
  Uncomment the folowing lines :
    Line 8, CPU_ONLY := 1
    Line 21, OPENCV_VERSION := 3
    Line 87, WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
    Line 99, USE_PKG_CONFIG := 1

  Uncomment and change the following lines :
    Line 46, OPENCV_VERSION := 3
    Line 74 to 76, If using python 3.x, then change the 3.4 to 3.x, where x is your version number
      PYTHON_LIBRARIES := boost_python3 python3.4m
      PYTHON_INCLUDE := /usr/include/python3.4m /usr/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/numpy/core/include
    Line 90 to 91, 
      INCLUDE_DIRS := $(PYTHON_INCLUDE) /usr/local/include /usr/include/hdf5/serial
      LIBRARY_DIRS := $(PYTHON_LIB) /usr/local/lib /usr/lib /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial
      
(5) Compile 
  make all -j4
  make pycaffe
  make test
  make runtest
  
  If no error when your run above 4 commands, then we have successfully installed caffe.
  But python will not be able to see it.
  
(6) Check example
  To check if the installation is corrrect, go into the python directory
  
  cd python
  
  Now run the following python code
  
    #!usr/bin/python3
    #file name : test_caffe.py


    import cv2   # for opencv
    import caffe # for caffe

(7) To avoid going into caffe/python everytime, add the caffe python foldr to the .bashrrc
  From caffe/python, run the following command
  
  echo "export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH"  >>  ~/.bashrc
  
  This will add /path/to/caffe/python to your python path and now, if you start python from any directort and do import caffe,
  it will run perfectly.
